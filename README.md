# 💬 RAG + SQL Based Chatbot Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a **RAG + SQL Based Chatbot** using Python. 
The project demonstrates how to build and interact with a chatbot in a step-by-step manner.

---

## 📌 Features
1. Interactive chatbot interface.
2. Uses natural language processing techniques.
3. Simple and easy-to-follow notebook format.
4. Modular code cells for better understanding.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ali-Jaan-Butt/rag-sql-chatbot.git
cd single-chatbot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
For **Windows**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For **Mac/Linux**:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the notebook `chatbot.ipynb` step by step.  
3. Interact with the chatbot by entering text inputs.

## 🧩 How It Works
- The notebook is divided into multiple cells.  
- Each cell introduces a new step:
  1. Importing libraries
  2. Defining preprocessing
  3. Creating the chatbot logic
  4. Running interaction loop
